# Dryad Data

This is the data you will submit with your paper, either to Dryad or another repository, or as supplemental materials. 

Some potential repositories to hold data are: 
 
- Dryad - https://datadryad.org/
- OSF - https://osf.io/
- FigShare - https://figshare.com/
- GitHub - store data directly in a GitHub repository and archive with Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) 

  
It's best to provide all Dryad / Supplemental data in basic csv files where possible. If for some reason that isn't possible, make sure the data can be opened with a program that is free and readily accessible.  

These will always be made public upon submission/publication.
