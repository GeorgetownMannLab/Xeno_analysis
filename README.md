# Reproducible Research Template

This is an example template to help format a research project from start to finish.

## Installation

This is a template repository, which means you can create a new repository with the same directory structure and files as this exisiting repository. It's similar to creating a fork, but the repository histories will be unrelated. 

To use this template, simply click *Use this Template*, select your account, and name your repository the same way you would when creating a new one. 


## Usage

There are eight folders by default, four of which will typically become part of your final public repository upon publication, and four which can remain private or local to you. You can change which folders and files and tracked with a *.gitignore* file. 

Each folder contains a readme with specific instructions. Recommended order is as follows: 

- RawData *(private)*
- DataCurationCode *(private)*
- SharedData *(public)*
- AnalysisCode *(public)*
- IntermediateData *(public)*
- TablesFigures *(public)*
- References *(private)*
- Drafts *(private)*
